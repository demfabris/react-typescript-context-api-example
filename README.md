# Readme

A cool React Typescript ContextAPI implementation

## Main specs

-   Typescript
-   ReactJS
-   Webpack
-   SASS

## About

### Why

Setup with Webpack from scratch ( no create-react-app ) allows me to have
greater control over variables and path resolving. SASS allows me to write less UI
javascript code. Typescript is just awesome.
I'm following the typescript-react-cheatsheet for best practices and
correctness [Link](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet)

## Running

So you'll have to run localy. Simply do :

`git clone https://github.com/fabricio7p/test_bhut.git ; cd test_bhut ; yarn install ; yarn start`
