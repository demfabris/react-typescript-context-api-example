## About

### Why

Setup with Webpack from scratch ( no create-react-app ) allows me to have
greater control over variables and path resolving. SASS allows me to write less UI
javascript code. Typescript is just awesome.
I'm following the typescript-react-cheatsheet for best practices and
correctness [Link](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet)

### What i would've done if i had more time

I'm having a quite busy week and i'm writing this readme at exactly 01:15 AM
30/07 so... Definelly Testing would be the first, then design consistency, then
animations and etc..
I could've used some CSS framework but i think it's important to have bare CSS
skills. Also i don't quite like them.

## Running

I tried to host it on as my personal domain (you can see it at
bhut.fabricio7p.com.br) but your API rejects HTTPS so it's not possible due to
mixed content error.

So you'll have to run localy. Simply do :

`git clone https://github.com/fabricio7p/test_bhut.git ; cd test_bhut ; yarn install ; yarn start`

**If API endpoint changes please edit `src/constants/apiConfig.ts`**

By default this webserver hosts at `0:0:0:0:3000` because it works best for my
setup. If it doesn't work for you please fallback to `localhost` again.

## Wrapping up

TEST

I appreciate the oportunity, hope you guys like my work
